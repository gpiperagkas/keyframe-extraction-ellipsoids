# keyframe-extraction-ellipsoids
Keyframe extraction using ellipsoid fitting and semantic graphs for teaching robots assembly tasks

This repository provides the source code for the keyframe extraction method using ellipsoids for 
modelling objects and semantic graphs, for teaching assembly by demonstration in robots. The algorithm 
was developed for the SARAFun EU research project in 2016, and the methodology was published in 
IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, available online. 

The repository provides an experimental version of the source code, with multiple code segments commented out, 
but still available for experimentation. 

This version includes teaching a robot using 2 hands concurrently. 
Required libraries Eigen3, OpenCV, Boost, PCL.

Build using CMake. 
Use of PugiXML software for xml file processing. 

The source code is available with a GPLv3 licence.
